ðŸŽ“ What It Does: 
  EduGenie is a magical classroom companion designed to empower teachers, inspire creativity, and make lesson planning easier than ever. Think of it as your personal genie â€” but instead of granting wishes, it grants well-crafted lesson plans, interactive activities, and time-saving teaching materials.
  Powered by advanced Google Gemini AI, EduGenie understands what teachers need. Whether youâ€™re planning a week-long science unit, a quick language exercise, or creative assessments, it instantly generates ready-to-use outlines, explanations, and classroom resources tailored to your goals and grade level. 
  With EduGenie, educators can spend less time on paperwork and more time teaching, inspiring, and connecting with students. Its goal is simple â€” to bring a little bit of magic back into every classroom. From personalized learning ideas to creative worksheets, EduGenie is here to make education not just efficient, but enchanting.

  
ðŸŒŸ Our Mission: 
  We know that learning isnâ€™t always easy â€” sometimes studying feels overwhelming, and finding the right methods can be a challenge. For teachers, balancing creativity, planning, and busy schedules can be just as stressful. Thatâ€™s why we created EduGenie: to make learning more accessible, engaging, and magical for everyone.
  Our mission is to help people learn and teach more effectively by bringing AI-powered creativity into the classroom. We faced our own hurdles while building EduGenie â€” from connecting the frontend and backend to merging files and debugging endless errors â€” but we kept pushing ourselves, trying new ideas, and learning as we went. In the end, weâ€™re proud of what we built and how far weâ€™ve come.
